# Beginning Tagged Enums

Lots of hacks were made to make this work. Need to look at those hacks and how I
can restructure the code to make it so they're not hacks.

Need to clean up:

1. Dependent and Scoped Types. QualifiedName class?
2. Need to keep better track of enum type fields - they need to be more accessible.
3. Better way to track and create dependent types.
4. Create a struct without putting it in the name list. (easy)
5. Struct Literal Initializers.

# Discussion

Should the types be declarable? Generally they must be because they're named in the arrow scope, e.g. `Literal::Number` is stated as the type of the variable.

What about this?
```
let a: Literal::Number;
let b: Literal;
```

Should these both allocate the enum tag type? I think they should, because anything that takes enum `Literal` should also take its members right?

I think it has to allocate the `Literal` type because of regular enums, e.g. `Void` in the example below. There would be no allocation

# Current State

```
extern fn printf(str: i8*, ...): void;

enum Literal {
    Void,
    String { size: i32; bytes: i8* }
    Number { value: i32 }
}

fn main(): i32 
{
    let a: Literal;

    if (a is Literal::Number) => (a_num: Literal::Number) {
        printf("%d\n", a_num.value);
    }

    return 1;
}
```

```ir
%Literal = type { i32, %Literal__String }
%Literal__String = type { i8*, i32 }
%Literal__Number = type { i32 }

@0 = internal constant [4 x i8] c"%d\0A\00"

declare void @printf(i8*, ...)

define i32 @main() {
entry:
  %a = alloca %Literal, align 8
  %0 = getelementptr inbounds %Literal, %Literal* %a, i32 0, i32 0
  %1 = load i32, i32* %0, align 4
  %2 = icmp eq i32 %1, 0
  br i1 %2, label %then, label %else

then:                                             ; preds = %entry
  %3 = getelementptr inbounds %Literal, %Literal* %a, i32 0, i32 1
  %4 = bitcast %Literal__String* %3 to %Literal__Number*
  %5 = bitcast %Literal__Number* %4 to i32*
  %6 = load i32, i32* %5, align 4
  call void (i8*, ...) @printf(i8* getelementptr inbounds ([4 x i8], [4 x i8]* @0, i32 0, i32 0), i32 %6)
  br label %7

else:                                             ; preds = %entry
  br label %7

7:                                                ; preds = %else, %then
  ret i32 1
}
```
