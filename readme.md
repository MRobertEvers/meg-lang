Sushi is my cat.

In this branch, we are officially compiling input source code.

Module expects single top level `fn` definition. Functions can have a single return statement.

This differs from `exploration_2` in that the code has been factored slightly (i.e. not one big file)

```
fn func(): i8 
{ 
    return 9*8; 
}
```
